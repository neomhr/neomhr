### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Neo. I currently spend my days building founder brands on LinkedIn for product-led SaaS founders.

I've spent a lot of time coding back when I was 14-16, some of that is still somewhere on this profile.

My most recent project on here is **Growth Stack** - The open-source knowledge directory for all things LinkedIn! Feel free to check it out. Hope it helps.

And PS: If you're a SaaS founder that's looking to turn LinkedIn into a major acquisition engine for your PLG motion, shoot me a DM on LinkedIn! I might be able to assist.

Cheers!
